  IMS Open Corpus Workbench: CWB/Perl Web GUI support Version 3.5.0

  compatible with CWB version 3.5.0


This package contains various support libraries for Web interfaces to
the CWB, most importantly a simple shared cache for CQP query results.
It is the successor of the WebCqp package available for CWB version 2.2.

CWB::Web has been made available in order to offer full CWB/Perl support
for the official release of CWB version 3.5, and maintain compatibility
with existing Web interfaces (some minor adjustments may required).
It may be absent, or radically different, in CWB version 4.0,


PREREQUISITES

The IMS Corpus Workbench and the basic CWB/Perl interfaces must be installed
on your computer.  In particular, the following modules are required

    HTML::Entities
    CWB::CQP (version 3.5 or newer)
    CWB::CL  (version 3.5 or newer)


QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

If you have never installed a Perl module before: don't despair.  All you
have to do is to execute the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You will probably have to login as root for the last step (or you can type
"sudo make install" and enter your normal password).  If you want to install
the CWB/Perl modules in a non-standard location, say in "~/perl/lib/perl5/..."
and "~/perl/man/...", type the following instead of "perl Makefile.PL":

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/perl/man/man1

Note that you will then have to include the appropriate subdirectories of
"~/perl/lib/perl5/" in your Perl search path in order to use the CWB modules.


PACKAGE OVERVIEW

The CWB::Web package contains the following Perl modules:

    CWB::Web::Cache     a transparent shared cache for CQP query results
    CWB::Web::Query     convenient front-end to CQP queries, with pre-formatted
                        kwic lines
    CWB::Web::Search    search-engine-like queries on CWB corpora

NB: The CWB::Web::Query and CWB::Web::Search modules do not make use of the CQP
query cache, so they are much less efficient than a custom implementation.

See the manual pages (e.g. "perldoc CWB::Web::Cache") of these modules for 
further, but still incomplete information.
