Version 3.5.0
-------------

Official long-term stable release of Perl/CWB to accompany CWB v3.5.0.


Version 3.4.0
-------------

Official release of Perl/CWB-Web on CPAN compatible with CWB v3.4 series.

TODO:
  - write unit tests for CWB::Web:: modules (esp. CWB::Web::Cache)
  - write extensive documentation for CWB::Web::Cache package
  - reimplement CWB::Web::Cache with cache index in SQLite database (faster and safer)
  - extend CWB::Web::FileCache for storage of arbitrary files indexed by metadata (as backend for CWB::Web::Cache)
  - rewrite CWB::Web::Query module for better performance and easy CWB::CEQL integration
  - re-think and re-implement CWB::Web::Search using MU-Queries and/or C code to achieve acceptable performance


Version 3.0
-----------

This is the first official release of the Web support modules for the redesigned CWB/Perl interface.
It is compatible with version 3.0 and above of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench.

New features:

  - WebCqp:: namespace changed to CWB::Web::
  
  - WebCqp::Persistent is now called CWB::Web::Cache, with updated documentation

  - This is an early release, made in order to offer full CWB/Perl coverage together with the official
    release 3.0 of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench.  All CWB::Web:: modules are scheduled for (partial or full)
    reimplementation, which may break backward compatibility.  In particular, new CGI scripts should not
    rely on the CWB::Web::Query and CWB::Web::Search modules.  Keep in mind that the latter is extremely
    inefficient in its current state and can only be used with very small corpora.
