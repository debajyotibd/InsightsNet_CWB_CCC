To compile, test and install all four Perl modules, you can use the top level 
Makefile.  (Ignore this file completely if you want to work with one or more 
modules individually; their Make systems are wholly independent of this 
top-level convenience utility.)

AVAILABLE TARGETS:

make
    Default target; run prep, then build, then test.

make prep
    Run each module's Makefile.PL script to prepare a makefile.

make build
    Run each module's Makefile default target. Implies prep.

make test
    Run test suite of each compiled module. Implies prep and build.

make install
    Install the modules. Probably needs root (su/sudo). Implies prep and build.

make clean
    Delete all created files (i.e. go back to fresh state of downloaded code).
