  IMS Open Corpus Workbench: CWB/Perl Version 3.5.0

  compatible with CWB version 3.5.0


This package contains a Perl interface for the IMS Open Corpus Workbench,
as well as several utility modules and scripts.  It is highly recommended
to install the CWB/Perl package even if no direct usage from Perl is intended.


PREREQUISITES

Before compiling the CWB/Perl package, you must install an up-to-date version
of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (see above for precise version requirements),
known for short as the "CWB Core".

You can either compile the CWB Core from source or install a binary package;
see instructions and links at https://cwb.sourceforge.io/.

If you did not install the CWB Core in a standard place (i.e. a directory in 
your search path), make sure that the "cwb-config" program can be executed
from the command line.  This will enable the CWB/Perl makefile to obtain the
necessary configuration information.


QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE

If you have never installed a Perl module before: don't despair.  All you
have to do is to execute the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You will probably have to login as root for the last step (or you can type
"sudo make install" and enter your normal password).  If you want to install
the CWB/Perl modules in a non-standard location, say in "~/perl/lib/perl5/..."
and "~/perl/man/...", type the following instead of "perl Makefile.PL":

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/perl/man/man1

Note that you will then have to include the appropriate subdirectories of
"~/perl/lib/perl5/" in your Perl search path in order to use the CWB modules.

If the "cwb-config" utility is not in your standard search path, you can 
specify its location with the --config option, for example:

    perl Makefile.PL --config=/opt/cwb-3.5/bin/cwb-config


TESTING CQP

"make test" will also run a fairly comprehensive test suite for CWB command-line
utilities and the CQP query processor. When testing CQP, additional options such
as 

    set Optimize on;

can temporarily be added to "data/files/init.cqp", which is loaded by all CQP
test scripts.


PACKAGE OVERVIEW

The CWB/Perl package contains the following Perl modules:

    CWB           general utility functions, registry editor
    CWB::CQP      run CQP process in the background
    CWB::Encoder  stream-lined encoding and indexing of CWB corpora
    CWB::CEQL     an implementation of the CEQL simple query language

See the manual pages (e.g. "perldoc CWB::CQP") of these modules for further
information.  The package also installs a number of command-line utility
programs:

    cwb-make            stream-lined indexing & compression of attributes
    cwb-regedit         simple registry editor for the command line
    cwb-split-vrt       split CWB input data into multiple chunks
    cwb-convert-to-utf8 convert indexed corpus to UTF-8 encoding
    cwb-align-import    import existing sentence alignment into CWB
    cwb-align-export    export existing sentence alignment from CWB
    cwb-align-tmx2beads reformat TMX aligned data for use with CWB

Type e.g. "cwb-make -h" for a usage summary, and "perldoc cwb-make" for the
full manual page.
