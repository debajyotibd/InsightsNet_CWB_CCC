Version 3.5.0
-------------

Official long-term stable release of Perl/CWB to accompany CWB v3.5.0.


Version 3.4.33
--------------

Official release of Perl/CWB on CPAN compatible with CWB v3.4.33.
Unlike the other Perl/CWB Version numbers will be kept in sync with CWB 3.4.x releases until
the LTS version 3.5.0 is ready for release.

New features:

  - C API and test update in sync with CWB development up to v3.4.33


Version 3.4.12+
---------------

This is the current development version of the redesigned Perl API for the low-level CL library.
It is compatible with version 3.4 of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench.

New features:

  - all "scalar" CL functions are now vectorised in the XS/C code, making them up to
    4x faster if called with long argument lists

  - Perl wrappers around the API functions have been eliminated wherever possible

  - some additional utility functions included in Perl API (e.g. case/accent-folding of strings,
    listing all attributes in a corpus [v3.4.13])

  - complete and thorough documentation [v3.4.13]
