##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##    Self-contained binary release package for MacOS (ARM 64-bit, "Apple Silicon")
##    with prerequisite libraries statically linked into "libcl.dylib".  Suitable
##    versions of the libraries (for MacOS >= 11.0) must be marshalled into
##    assets/darwin-arm64/ before compilation.  The resulting package should
##    be compatible with all MacOS version >= 11.0 (Big Sur).
##


## Inherits from Darwin release configuration for Intel 64-bit
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin-release

## Compile for Apple Silicon (M1 and other ARM 64-bit CPUs)
## Currently, Apple GCC doesn't support any sensible -march, -mcpu or -mtune options.
## We also want the binary package to work on older MacOS versions than the one it
## was built in, but this depends on the prerequisite libraries marshalled in assets/.
## With libraries from CRAN, we can achieve compatibility with MacOS 11.0 (Big Sur):
##    -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
## To select a suitable SDK version for cross-compilation set ISYSROOT in "local_config.mk", e.g.
##    ISYSROOT = -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk
## for cross-compilation of ARM binaries on MacOS 10.15.
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch arm64 -mmacosx-version-min=11.0 $(ISYSROOT)
LDFLAGS = -arch arm64 -mmacosx-version-min=11.0 $(ISYSROOT)

## Header files and static libraries for all prerequisites must be marshalled in
## assets/darwin-arm64 and are linked from there
ASSETS = $(TOP)/assets/darwin-arm64

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = arm64
RELEASE_OS = macos-11.0
