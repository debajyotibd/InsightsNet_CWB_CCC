##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##    Natively tuned Intel 64-bit binaries for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and newer,
##    with prerequisite libraries provided by HomeBrew package manager
##

## Inherits from basic Darwin configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin

## Make sure that Apple's gcc is used (not e.g. a fink-installed version)
CC = /usr/bin/gcc

## Tune for CPU of the build machine, compiling only 64-bit code
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch x86_64 -march=native -mtune=native

DEPEND_CFLAGS = -Wall -O3

## We can use pkg-config to determine suitable compiler and linker flags for
## Glib and PCRE. They point to specific versions of the libraries in the Cellar,
## but their install names have the stable opt/... path, so upgrades don't break.
PCRE_DEFINES := $(shell pkg-config --cflags libpcre2-8)
PCRE_LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs libpcre2-8)

GLIB_DEFINES = $(shell pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0)
GLIB_LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs glib-2.0)

## HomeBrew refuses to link Readline on MacOS, so it's not visible to pkg-config
READLINE_DEFINES = -I/usr/local/opt/readline/include
READLINE_LIBS = -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib -lreadline -lhistory

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = x86_64

## Optionally use newer Bison from HomeBrew (MacOS ships bison 2.3, which is > 15 years old)
# YACC = /usr/local/opt/bison@2.7/bin/bison -d -t
# YACC = /usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison -d -t
