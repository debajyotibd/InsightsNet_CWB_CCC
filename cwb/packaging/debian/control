Description: Indexing and query tools for very large text corpora
 The IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB) is a highly specialised read-only
 database for large text corpora with linguistic annotations.  It uses
 a bespoke and platform-independent compressed file format to store 
 corpus data with token-level annotations and shallow structural markup.
 Its central component is the corpus query processor CQP, a terminal
 application designed for interactive work.  In addition to CQP, the
 distribution includes a number of command-line utilities for encoding,
 decoding and extracting frequency information.  Low-level access to 
 the corpus data is possible through the included C libary (CL).  Perl
 bindings for the library and the query processor are available separately.
