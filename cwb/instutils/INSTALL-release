    IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB)
    Release 3.5

    Usage Guide for Binary Packages on MacOS and other Unix platforms


This binary release of CWB v3.5 is a self-contained package that does not
require any further installation.  Simply unpack the archive in an arbitrary
location on the target computer and you're good to go!

Please make sure that you have downloaded the appropriate package for your
platform: both CPU architecture and operating system must match.

If you encounter problems, it's best to join the CWBdev mailing list

    http://devel.sslmit.unibo.it/mailman/listinfo/cwb

and ask your question there.


You can run CQP and the other CWB command-line tools by specifying full paths
to the binaries in the "bin/" subdirectory. For example, from the root directory
of the package you can start an interactive CQP session with

	bin/cqp -eC

The correct absolute path can be obtained with

	bin/cwb-config --bindir

You can also add this directory to your $PATH or symlink the required binaries.

If you want to link your own C code against libcl (the Corpus Library), you can
obtain suitable compiler and linker flags with

	cwb-config --cflags
	cwb-config --ldflags

specifying an absolute path to cwb-config if necessary.  When installing the
CWB/Perl packages via CPAN, temporarily add the "bin/" subdirectory of this
package at the start of your $PATH so the Perl configuration will pick up the
correct version of cwb-config.  Alternatively, perform a manual installation
and specify the full path to cwb-config with "perl Makefile.PL --config=...".

NOTICE TO MACOS USERS: MacOS 11 and newer ship with universal binaries that 
work both on Intel and ARM platforms. Since we do not provide universal binary
packages of CWB, installation of the CWB::CL module will fail with the 
system-provided Perl interpreter. It is recommended to install an up-to-date
version of Perl with HomeBrew in order to use CWB/Perl.
