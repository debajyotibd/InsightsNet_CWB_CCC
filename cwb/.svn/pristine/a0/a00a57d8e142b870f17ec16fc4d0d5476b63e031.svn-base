##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: binary release for Debian .deb packaging
##

## Inherits from configuration for binary releases on Linux
include $(TOP)/config/site/linux-release

## Temporary installation prefix for Debian, i.e. the packaging root
PREFIX = $(TOP)/fakeroot/usr
## Final installation prefix on the system
FINALPREFIX = /usr

## but we must ensure that the default registry points to the final install location
DEFAULT_REGISTRY = /usr/local/share/cwb/registry

## For Debian packaging, i686 is not a valid architecture label, even though `uname -m` supplies it.
## Instead, i386 MEANS i686. So, we convert i686 to i386 here, so things will work if someone 
## makes a .deb on a 32-bit Linux box (why anyone would want to is beyond my ken though!)
ifeq ($(RELEASE_ARCH),i686)
  RELEASE_ARCH := i386
endif
