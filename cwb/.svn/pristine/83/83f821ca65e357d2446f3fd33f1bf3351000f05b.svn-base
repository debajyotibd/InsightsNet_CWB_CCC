##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##    Self-contained binary release package for MacOS (Intel 64-bit) with 
##    prerequisite libraries statically linked into "libcl.dylib".  Static
##    versions of the prerequisite libraries are provided by HomeBrew package
##    manager.
##

##
## --- WARNING ---
## HomeBrew is not ideal for binary releases.  While statically linked libraries
## can be created, they are always compiled for the current MacOS version and 
## will NOT be compatible with earlier MacOS releases.  It is also impossible
## to cross-compile ARM binaries on an Intel CPU.
## A quick Web search suggests that there is no feasible work-around. In fact,
## HomeBrew goes out of its way to keep users from modifying compilation settings.
##

## Inherits from release configuration for Intel 64-bit
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin-brew-release

## Compile for Apple Silicon (M1 and other ARM CPUs)
## Currently, Apple GCC doesn't support any sensible -march, -mcpu or -mtune options
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch arm64
LDFLAGS = -arch arm64

## HomeBrew uses a separate directory tree for ARM64
HOMEBREW_ROOT = /opt/homebrew

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = arm64
