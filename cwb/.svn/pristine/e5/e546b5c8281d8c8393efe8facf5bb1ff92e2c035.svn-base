##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##    Self-contained binary release package for MacOS (Intel 64-bit) with 
##    prerequisite libraries statically linked into "libcl.dylib".  Suitable
##    versions of the libraries (for MacOS >= 10.13) must be marshalled into
##    assets/darwin-x86_64/ before compilation.  The resulting package should
##    be compatible with all MacOS version >= 10.13 (High Sierra).
##


## Inherits from basic Darwin configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin

## Make sure that Apple's gcc is used (not e.g. a fink-installed version)
CC = /usr/bin/gcc

## Make sure we're compatible with most current x86 CPUs, but optimise for Core i7.
## We also want the binary package to work on older MacOS versions than the one it
## was built in, but this depends on the prerequisite libraries marshalled in assets/.
## With libraries from CRAN, we can achieve compatibility with MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra):
##    -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
## To select a suitable SDK version for cross-compilation set ISYSROOT in "local_config.mk", e.g.
##    ISYSROOT = -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk
## for cross-compilation of ARM binaries on MacOS 10.15.
