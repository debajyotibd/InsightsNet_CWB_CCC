## Filename of CL shared library on MacOS
LIBCL_SHAREDLIB = libcl.dylib

## New default is to link CWB binaries dynamically
LIBCL_TYPE = shared

## It isn't necessary to specify the -rpath explicitly when linking against libcl.dylib
## (beacuse linker will obtain path from install name of the .dylib).
## The default logic in definitions.mk can be disabled with this setting, if desired:
# LIBCL_RPATH = $(DONT_SET_LIBCL_RPATH)
